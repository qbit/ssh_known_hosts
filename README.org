** Verifications

*** Consensus

To test consensus of the known hosts, run ~make generate~. This will re-fetch
the entries for the ~*.hosts~ files. If there are no changes to the .kh files
(according to git), you have achieved consensus.

*** Tor

The make target ~generate-via-tor~ will attempt to connect to the hosts using
~torsocks~. Running ~make generate-via-tor~ ideally will produce .kh files
with no difference to what is in the git repository currently.
